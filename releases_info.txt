Body: See the fully release announcement at https://community.plotly.com/t/announcing-plotly-py-4-13-magical-error-messages-and-documentation-plus-speedups-and-faceted-maps/47497

### Added

- `px.choropleth`, `px.scatter_geo` and `px.line_geo` now support faceting as well as `fitbounds` and `basemap_visible` [2923](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2923)
- `px.scatter_geo` and `px.line_geo` now support `geojson`/`featureidkey` input [2923](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2923)
- `px.scatter_geo` now supports `symbol` [2923](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2923)
- `go.Figure` now has a `set_subplots` method to set subplots on an already
  existing figure. [2866](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2866)
- Added `Turbo` colorscale and fancier swatch display functions
  [2882](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2882)
- A utility function `image_array_to_data_uri` has been added in
  `plotly.utils`, in order to transform NumPy arrays to data b64 URIs (which
  can be passed to the source parameter of `go.Image`, or to layout images).
  [2879](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2879)
- the `selector` argument to updater/selector functions now accepts `int`s and `str`s
  [2894](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2894)


### Updated

- the JSON serialization of plotly figures has been accelerated thanks to a
  different handling of Infinity and NaN values. For example, a figure with a
  1000x1000 Heatmap should now serialize 2x faster. [2880](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2880)
- Coding mistakes with "magic underscores" now return significantly more ergonomic error
  messages [2843](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2843)

  [2897](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2897)


### Fixed

- `px.scatter_geo` support for `text` is fixed [2923](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2923)
- the `x` and `y` parameters of `px.imshow` are now used also in the case where
  an Image trace is used (for RGB data or with `binary_string=True`). However,
  only numerical values are accepted (while the Heatmap trace allows date or
  string values for `x` and `y`). [2761](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2761)

Release Name: v4.12.0 - Horizontal and Vertical Lines and Rectangles 
Tag Name: v4.12.0
Published at: 2020-10-23T13:32:48Z
Body: See the full release announcement at https://community.plotly.com/t/announcing-plotly-py-4-12-horizontal-and-vertical-lines-and-rectangles/46783

### Added

- For `add_trace`, `add_shape`, `add_annotation` and `add_layout_image`, the `row` and/or `col` argument now also accept the string `"all"`. `row="all"` adds the object to all the subplot rows and `col="all"` adds the object to all the subplot columns. ([#2840](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2840))
- Shapes that reference the plot axes in one dimension and the data in another dimension can be added with the new `add_hline`, `add_vline`, `add_hrect`, `add_vrect` functions, which also support the `row="all"` and `col="all"` arguments. ([#2840](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2840))
- The `add_trace`, `add_shape`, `add_annotation`, `add_layout_image`, `add_hline`, `add_vline`, `add_hrect`, `add_vrect` functions accept an argument `exclude_empty_subplots` which if `True`, only adds the object to subplots already containing traces or layout objects. This is useful in conjunction with the `row="all"` and `col="all"` arguments. ([#2840](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2840))
- For all `go.Figure` functions accepting a selector argument (e.g., `select_traces`), this argument can now also be a function which is passed each relevant graph object (in the case of `select_traces`, it is passed every trace in the figure). For graph objects where this function returns true, the graph object is included in the selection. ([#2844](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2844))

### Updated

- Updated Plotly.js to version 1.57.1. See the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/v1.57.1/CHANGELOG.md) for more information. These changes are reflected in the auto-generated `plotly.graph_objects` module.

### Updated

- Updated Plotly.js to version 1.55.2. See the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/v1.55.2/CHANGELOG.md) for more information. These changes are reflected in the auto-generated `plotly.graph_objects` module.
- `px.imshow` has a new `binary_string` boolean argument, which passes the
  image data as a b64 binary string when True. Using binary strings allow for
  faster image rendering and smaller figure size. Additional optional arguments
  `binary_backend`, `binary_format` and `binary_compression_level` control
  how to generate the b64 string ([#2691](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2691)
- `px.imshow` has a new `constrast_rescaling` argument in order to choose how
  to set data values corresponding to the bounds of the color range
  ([#2691](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2691)

### Fixed

- Plotly Express no longer converts datetime columns of input dataframes to UTC ([#2749](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2749))
- Plotly Express has more complete support for datetimes as additional `hover_data` ([#2749](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2749))

### Added

- Added image export support using [Kaleido](https://github.com/plotly/Kaleido). The image export backend can be configured using the new `engine` argument to `plotly.io.to_image` and `plotly.io.write_image`. The `engine` argument may be set to `"kaleido"`, `"orca"`, or `"auto"`. The default is `engine="auto"`, in which case the Kaleido backend is enabled if the `kaleido` package from PyPI is installed, otherwise Orca is used. ([#2613](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2613)).

- `facet_row_spacing` and `facet_col_spacing` added to Plotly Express cartesian 2d functions ([#2614](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2614))
- `base` added to Plotly Express `bar` and `bar_polar` functions ([#2626](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2626))
- `px.NO_COLOR` constant to override wide-form color assignment in Plotly Express ([#2614](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2614))

### Fixed

- trendline traces are now of type `scattergl` when `render_mode="webgl"` in Plotly Express ([#2614](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2614))
- regression from 4.8.1 whereby `"parent"` was not accepted as part of `path` for `px.sunburst()` and `px.treemap()` ([#2640](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2640))
- `create_dendrogram()` figure factory now works correctly with `scipy` 1.5.1 ([#2627](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2627))

### Updated

Release Name: v4.8.0 - Plotly Express Support for Wide- and Mixed-Form Data, plus a Pandas backend
Tag Name: v4.8.0
Published at: 2020-05-26T14:21:41Z
Body: See the full announcement at https://community.plotly.com/t/announcing-plotly-py-4-8-plotly-express-support-for-wide-and-mixed-form-data-plus-a-pandas-backend/40048

### Key new documentation pages:

- [Wide-form and mixed-form data support in Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/wide-form/)
- [Pandas plotting backend](https://plotly.com/python/pandas-backend/)

### Added

- [`plotly` now provides a Plotly Express-backed Pandas-compatible plotting backend](https://plotly.com/python/pandas-backend/), which can be activated via `pandas.options.plotting.backend = "plotly"`. Note that it is not intended to implement every Pandas plotting function, nor is it intended to replicate the behaviour of every argument, although per the changes below, `x` and `y` should behave similarly. ([#2336](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2336))
- New datasets have been added to `plotly.express.data`: `stocks`, `experiment`, `medals_wide` and `medals_long`. ([#2336](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2336))
- plotly `go.Figure` and `go.FigureWidget` now have a `_repr_html_` and a `_repr_mimebundle_` method, which are [standard hooks for integration in systems based on IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/integrating.html). In particular, with `_repr_html_` plotly figures can now be used within [sphinx-gallery](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html) without any scraper. These additions should not change anything to the way plotly figures are displayed in notebook environments, since the `_ipython_display_` method (already present in earlier versions) takes precedence over the new methods.

### Updated

- The behaviour of the `x`, `y`, `orientation`, `histfunc`, `violinmode`, `boxmode` and `stripmode` arguments for 2d-cartesian functions in Plotly Express (i.e. `scatter`, `line`, `area`, `bar`, `histogram`, `violin`, `box`, `strip`, `funnel`, `density_heatmap` and `density_contour`) has been refined ([#2336](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2336)):
    - [wide-form data support](https://plotly.com/python/wide-form/): if either `x` or `y` (but not both) may now be provided as a list of column references into `data_frame` or columns of data, in which case the imputed data frame will be treated as "wide" data and `melt()`ed internally before applying the usual mapping rules, with function-specific defaults.
    - if neither `x` nor `y` is provided but `data_frame` is, the data frame will be treated as "wide" with defaults depending on the value of `orientation` (and `orientation` has accordingly been added to `scatter`, `line`, `density_heatmap`, and `density_contour` for this purpose). Previously this would have resulted in an empty figure.
    - if `x` or `y` is missing, it is inferred to be the index of `data_frame` if `data_frame` provided, otherwise a stable index of integers starting at 0. In the case of `px.bar`, if the provided value is not continuous, the missing value is treated as a column of 1s named "count", so as to behave more like `px.histogram` and to avoid sizing the resulting bars differently based on their position in the column. Previously, missing values defaulted to integers starting at 0 *per trace* which made it potentially inconsistent or misleading.
    - if `x` (`y`) is missing, `orientation` now defaults to `v` (`h`). Previously it always defaulted to `v` but this is not considered a breaking change, as the cases in which it now defaults to `h` caused unreadable output if set to `v`.
    - if both `x` and `y` are provided and one of them does not contain continuous values, `orientation` defaults to the value perpendicular to that axis. Previously it always defaulted to `v` but this is not considered a breaking change, as the cases in which it now defaults to `h` caused unreadable output if set to `v`.
    - if both `x` and `y` are provided to `histogram`, and if `x`, `y` and `z` are provided to `density_heatmap` or `density_contour`, then `histfunc` now defaults to `sum` so as to avoid ignoring the provided data, and to cause `histogram` and `bar` to behave more similarly.
    - `violinmode`, `boxmode` and `stripmode` now default to `overlay` if `x` (`y`) in in `v` (`h`) orientation is also mapped to `color`, to avoid strange spacing issues with the previous default of `group` in all cases.
- The Plotly Express arguments `color_discrete_map`, `symbol_map` and `line_dash_map` now accept the string `"identity"` which causes the corresponding input data to be used as-is rather than mapped into `color_discrete_sequence`, `symbol_sequence` or `line_dash_sequence`, respectively. ([#2336](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2336))
- Plotly Express now accepts `px.Constant` or `px.Range` objects in the place of column references so as to express constant or increasing integer values. ([#2336](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2336))

Release Name: v4.7.1
Tag Name: v4.7.1
Published at: 2020-05-08T13:10:40Z
Body: ### Fixed

 - Fix `AttributeError: module 'plotly.graph_objs' has no attribute 'FigureWidget'` exception on `from plotly.graph_objs import *` when `ipywidgets` is not installed. Error also occurred when importing `plotly.figure_factor`. It is now possible to import `plotly.graph_objs.FigureWidget` when `ipywidgets` is not installed, and an informative `ImportError` exception will be raised in the `FigureWidget` constructor ([#2443](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/2443), [#1111](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1111)).
 - Fix `TypeError: unhashable type: 'Template'` during `Figure` construction when `plotly.io.templates.default` is set to a `Template` object rather than a string.
--------------------------------------------------
Release Name: v4.7.0
Tag Name: v4.7.0
Published at: 2020-05-06T16:26:21Z
Body: ### Updated

- Updated Plotly.js to version 1.54.1. See the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/v1.54.1/CHANGELOG.md) for more information. The main new feature of this version of Plotly.js is the possibility to draw layout shapes, using custom dragmodes and corresponding modebar buttons.
- The sphinx-gallery scraper has been updated to work with different structures of galleries [#2149](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2419)

### Added

- The `hover_data` parameter of `px` functions can now be a dictionary. This makes it possible to skip hover information for some arguments or to change the formatting of hover informatiom [#2377](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2377).
- It's now possible to build a development version of Plotly.py against the build artifacts from a non-`master` branch of Plotly.js, which makes for faster QA and development cycles [#2349](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2349). Thanks [@zouhairm](https://github.com/zouhairm) for this Pull Request!

### Fixed

- Plotly Express trendlines now handle missing data correctly [#2357](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2357)

### Performance

This version includes several performance improvements ([#2368](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2368), [#2403](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2403)).
 
 - Child graph objects (e.g. `figure.layout.xaxis`) are no longer created eagerly during graph object construction. Instead, they are created lazily the first time the property is accessed.
 - Property validation is now disabled for select internal operations.
 - When used with Python 3.7 and above, ploty.py now takes advantage of [PEP-562](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0562/) to perform submodule imports lazily.  This dramatically improves import times.

This is a major release that includes many new features, and a few breaking changes. See the [version 4 announcement](https://community.plot.ly/t/introducing-plotly-py-4-0-0rc1/25639) for a summary of the important changes.

### Updated
 - Updated Plotly.js to version 1.48.3. See the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1483----2019-06-13) for more information.

### Added
 - The Plotly Express tech preview (https://medium.com/@plotlygraphs/introducing-plotly-express-808df010143d) has been integrated as the `plotly.express` module ([#1613](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1613))
 - Added a new renderers framework the supports rendering figure in a wide variety of contexts ([#1474](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1474)). See the new [Displaying Plotly Figures](https://plot.ly/python/next/renderers) documentation page for more information.
 - Added `plotly.io.write_html` and `plotly.io.to_html` functions for exporting figures to HTML ([1474](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1474)). Also available as `.write_html` and `.to_html` figure methods.
 - Added new figure methods for batch updating figure properties (`update_layout`, `update_traces`, `update_xaxes`, etc.) ([#1624](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1624)).  See the new [Creating and Updating Figures](https://plot.ly/python/next/creating-and-updating-figures/) documentation page for more details.
 - Added support for all trace types in `make_subplots` ([#1528](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1528))
 - Added support for secondary y-axes in `make_subplots` ([#1564](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1564))
 - Support passing a scalar trace object (rather than a list or tuple of trace objects) as the `data` property to the `Figure` constructor ([#1614](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1614))
 - Added dictionary-stule `.pop` method to graph object classes ([#1614](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1614))
 - New `jupyterlab-plotly` JupyterLab extension for rendering figures in JupyterLab. Replaces the `@jupyterlab/plotly-extension` extension, and includes JupyterLab 1.0 support.
 - Added new suite of built-in colorscales to the `plotly.colors` module, and support for specifying this wide range of colorscales by name. Also added support for specifying colorscales as a list of colors, in which case the color spacing is assumed to be uniform ([#1647](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1647)).
 - Added `sphinx-gallery` renderer for embedding plotly figures in [Sphinx-Gallery](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/) ([#1577](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1577), [plotly/plotly-sphinx-gallery](https://github.com/plotly/plotly-sphinx-gallery)).
 
### Removed
 - The follow modules for interfacing with the Chart Studio cloud service have been removed from plotly.py and moved to the new `chart-studio` distribution package.  The following modules have been moved to a new top-level `chart_studio` module:
   - `plotly.plotly` -> `chart_studio.plotly`
   - `plotly.api` -> `chart_studio.api`
   - `plotly.dashboard_objs` -> `chart_studio.dashboard_objs`
   - `plotly.grid_objs` -> `chart_studio.grid_objs`
   - `plotly.presentation_objs` -> `chart_studio.presentation_objs`
 - The legacy `plotly.widgets.GraphWidget` class for displaying online figures hosted by Chart Studio as ipywidgets has been removed. Please use the offline, and much more capable, `plotly.graph_objects.FigureWidget` class instead.
 - The `fileopt` argument to `chart_studio.plotly.plot` has been removed, so in-place modifications to previously published figures are no longer supported, and a figure will always overwrite a figure with the same name. 

### Changed
 - The `'plotly'` template is used as the default theme across all figures.
 - In order to reduce the size of the core `plotly` distribution package, the bundled geographic shape files used by the `create_choropleth` figure factory have been moved to a new optional `plotly-geo` distribution package ([1604](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1604))
 - For consistency with other figure factories, the `create_choropleth`  and `create_gantt` figure factories now always returns `Figure` objects, rather than dictionaries ([#1600](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1600), [#1607](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1607)).
 - Figure add trace methods (`.add_trace`, `.add_traces`, `.add_scatter`, etc.) now return a reference to the calling figure, rather than the newly created trace ([#1624](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1624))
 - `plotly.tools.make_subplots` has been moved to `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`, though it is still available at the previous location for backward compatibility
 - The `plotly.graph_objs` module has been moved to `plotly.graph_objects`, though it is still available at the previous location for backward compatibility ([#1614](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1614))
 - Trace `uid` properties are only generated automatically when a trace is added to a `FigureWidget`.  When a trace is added to a standard `Figure` graph object the input `uid`, if provided, is accepted as is ([#1580](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1580)).
 - `datetime` objects that include timezones are not longer converted to UTC ([#1581](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1581))
 - When a tuple property (e.g. `layout.annotations`) is updated with a list/tuple that is longer than the current value, the extra elements are appended to the end of the tuple.

### Fixed
 - Fixed visibility of `bar` trace error bars in built-in templates ([1656](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1656))

 - Add legend `itemclick` and `itemdoubleclick` attributes to set or disable the legend item click and double-click behavior ([#3862](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3862))
 - Added support for calling orca through [Xvfb](https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml) to support static image export on Linux when X11 is not available ([#1523](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1523)).

### Fixed
 - Fixed `PlotlyJSONEncoder` encoding error when `simplejson` is installed ([#1556](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1556), [#1561](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1561))
 - HTML export now honors the figure height specified in the figure template ([#1560](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1560))
 - Fixed display height of figure displayed in JupyterLab ([#1572](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1572),
 [#1571](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1571))
 - Fixed honouring of the `validate=False` option for all renderer types ([#1576](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1576))

 for more information.
 
### Added
 - Three new trace types: `sunburst` ([plotly/plotly.js#3594](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3594)),  `waterfall` ([plotly/plotly.js#3531](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3531)), and `volume` ([plotly/plotly.js#3488](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3488)).

Release Name: v3.5.0
Tag Name: v3.5.0
Published at: 2019-02-01T23:01:07Z
Body: ## [3.5.0] - 2019-01-04

### Updated
 - Updated Plotly.js to version 1.43.1. See the
 [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1431----2018-12-21)
 for more information.
 
### Changed
 - Plotly.js 1.43 converted `title` properties (e.g. `layout.title`) from
 strings into compound objects that contain the text as the `text` property
 along with new title placement attributes `x`, `y`, `xref`, `yref`, `xanchor`,
 `yanchor` and `pad`. Plotly.py 3.5.0 follows the new schema, but still
 supports specifying `title` as a string, in which case the string is assigned
 to the `title.text` property
 ([#1302](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1302))
 - Plotly.js 1.43 also moved existing `title*` properties
 (e.g. `layout.titlefont`) under the `title` object (e.g. `layout.title.font`).
 Plotly.py 3.5.0 follows the new schema, but still
 supports the legacy `title*` properties by mapping them to the corresponding
 `title.*` property
 ([#1302](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1302))
 - The `update` method on `graph_objs` now returns the updated object in order
 to support chaining multiple update operations together
 ([#1379](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1379))
 - The `show_link` option has been set to `False` by default in the offline
 `plot` and `iplot` functions. Now that the "send data to cloud" button has
 been disabled by default in plotly.js 1.43.0, no buttons/links will be
 displayed by default that result in data being sent off of the local machine
 ([#1304](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1304))
 - `config` options that are not known by plotly.py result in a warning but are
 still passed along to plotly.js. Prior to this change these unknown options
 were dropped silently
 ([#1290](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1290))
 - Built-in themes now specify colorscales using the new global
 `layout.colorscale` properties.  Previously the colorscales were defined for
 each trace type individually. This reduces the size of the resulting theme
 files 
 ([#1303](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1303))
 - Increased the maximum retry time of the orca integration from 8s to 30s
 ([#1297](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1297))
 
### Fixed
 - Fixed `FigureWidget` performance regression that, when working with
 large datasets, resulted in a slight freeze of the widget after user
 interactions (pan, zoom, etc)
 ([1305](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1305)) 
 - Fix orca error when the `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` environment variable is set
 ([#1293](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1293))
 - The `'responsive'` config key was being silently blocked
 ([#1290](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1290))
 - Fixed error when using unicode characters in string properties on Python 2
 ([#1289](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1289))
 - Removed invalid calls to non-existent `validate` and `strip_style` `Figure`
 methods in matplotlylib conversion logic

Published at: 2018-11-23T16:26:24Z
Body: ## [3.4.2] - 2018-11-23

### Fixed
 - `config` options are now supported when using `plotly.offline.iplot` to
 display a figure in JupyterLab. Requires version 0.18.1 of the 
 `@jupyterlab/plotly-extension` extension.
 ([#1281](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1281), [jupyterlab/jupyter-renderers#168](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-renderers/pull/168))

 [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1423----2018-11-06)
 for more information.
 
### Fixed
 - Fixed histogram binning with pandas `Series` or numpy array
 (regression introduced in 3.4.0)
 ([#1257](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1257), 
  [plotly/plotly.js#3211](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3211))

 the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1422----2018-11-01) for more information.
 
### Added
 - Default figure properties may now be customized using figure
 templates (themes) and 7 new predefined templates are bundled with
 plotly.py
 ([#1224](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1224))
 - Added Parallel Categories (`parcats`) trace type for the visualization
 of multi-dimensional categorical datasets
 ([plotly/plotly.js#2963](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2963))
 - Added LaTeX typesetting support for figures displayed in the Jupyter
 Notebook using `plotly.offline.iplot` and `plotly.graph_objs.FigureWidget`.
 **Note:** There are still outstanding issues with MathJax rendering in FireFox,
 but it is now working well in Chrome.
 ([#1243](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1243))
 - Added `include_mathjax` argument to `plotly.offline.plot` to support
 the creation of HTML files with LaTeX typesetting
 ([#1243](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1243))
 - Added new `plotly.offline.get_plotlyjs` function that returns the
 contents of the bundled plotly.js library as a string
 ([#637](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/637),
  [#1246](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1246))
 - Added new `plotly.offline.get_plotlyjs_version` function that returns
 the version of the bundled plotly.js library
 ([#1246](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1246))
 - HTML div strings returned by `plotly.offline.plot` now contain logic
 to automatically resize the figure responsively.  This logic was previously
 only added for html files.

 Notebook will now resize responsively
 ([#1234](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1234))
 - Added `'cdn'`, `'directory'`, and path string `include_plotlyjs` options
 in `plotly.offline.plot`
 ([#1234](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1234))
   - When `'cdn'`, the resulting html file/div includes a script tag reference
   to the plotlyjs cdn.
   - When `'directory'`, the resulting html file/div includes a script tag
   reference to a plotly.min.js bundle in the same directory as the html file.
   If `output_type` is `'file'` then this plotly.min.js bundle is created in
   the output directory if it doesn't already exist.
   - When a string ending with `'.js'`, the resulting html file/div includes
   a script tag that references this exact path. This can be used to point
   to a plotly.js bundle from an alternative CDN.
 - Added a new `color_threshold` argument to the `create_dendrogram` figure
 factory to control the dendrogram clustering cutoff
 ([#995](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/995),
  [#1075](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1075),
  [#1214](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1214))  
 - Added support for `autorange='reversed'` in 3D axes 
 ([#803](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/803),
  [plotly/plotly.js#3141](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3141))

 `orientation`, `bgcolor`, `color` and `activecolor`
 ([plotly/plotly.js#3068](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3068),
  [plotly/plotly.js#3091](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3091))
 - Added `title`, `titleposition` and `titlefont` attributes to pie traces
 ([plotly/plotly.js#2987](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2987))
 - Added `hoverlabel.split` attribute to `ohlc` and `candlestick` traces to
 split hover labels into multiple pieces
 ([plotly/plotly.js#2959](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2959))
 - Added support for `line.shape` values `'hv'`, `'vh'`, `'hvh'`
 and `'vhv'` in `scattergl` traces
 ([plotly/plotly.js#3087](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3087))
 - Added trace, node and link `hoverinfo` for `sankey` traces
 ([#3096](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3096),
  [#3150](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3150))
 - Added per-sector `textfont` settings in pie traces
 ([#3130](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3130))
 
 
### Changed
 - Use new Plotly logo in "Produced with Plotly" modebar button
 ([plotly/plotly.js#3068](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3068))


### Fixed
 - Plotly's use of MathJax for LaTeX typesetting no longer interferes with
 the Jupyter Notebook's use of MathJax
 ([#445](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/445), 
  [#360](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/360))
 - Fixed several issues with the use of `reversescale=True` in the
 `create_annotated_heatmap` figure factory
 ([#1251](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1251))
 - Fixed case where `plotly.offline.iplot` would fail to render in the classic
 Jupyter Notebook if the notebook contained a Markdown headline with the text
 "Plotly"
 ([#816](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/816))
 - `None` values in a `scatter.hovertext` list are now omitted from the 
 hover label rather than being displayed as the string `"None"`
 ([#1244](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1244))
 - Subplot titles created by `plotly.tools.make_subplots` are now positioned
 properly when custom `row_width`/`column_width` arguments are specified
 ([#1229](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1229))
 - The `bar.width` property may now be specified as a numpy array or a pandas
 series
 ([#1231](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1231), 
 [plotly/plotly.js#3169](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3169))
 - Error bars are now scaled correctly for logarithmic `scatter3d` traces
 ([#1139](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1139))
 - Use `uuid.uuid4` rather than `uuid.uuid1` to work around an upstream
 Python bug
  ([#1235](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1235),
   [#1236](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1236))
 - The `layout.grid.subplots` property may now be specified as a 2D list of

--------------------------------------------------
Release Name: v3.3.0
Tag Name: v3.3.0
Published at: 2018-09-28T11:33:55Z
Body: ## [3.3.0] - 2018-09-28

### Updated
 - Updated Plotly.js to version 1.41.3.  Select highlights included below, see
 [the plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1413----2018-09-25)
 for more information.
 - Do not create or check permissions on the `~/.plotly` configuration directory until a configuration write operation is performed ([#1195](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1195)). This change avoids some concurrency problems associated with running many instances of
 plotly.py simultaneously ([#1068](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1068)).
 
### Added
 - Enable selection by clicking on points via new layout attribute `clickmode` and flag `'select'`
 ([#2944](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2944))
 - Added stacked area charts via new attributes `stackgroup` and `stackgaps` in scatter traces
 ([#2960](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2960))

 subplot offsetting the start of the radial range
 ([#2977](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2977), [#2996](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2996))
 - Figures may now be easily converted to and from JSON using the new
 `to_json`, `from_json`, `read_json`, and `write_json` functions in the
 `plotly.io` package
 ([#1188](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1188))
 - Figures and graph objects now support `deepcopy` and `pickle` operations
 ([#1191](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1191))
 - The location of the `"~/.plotly"` settings directory may now be customized
 using the `PLOTLY_DIR` environment variable
 ([#1195](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1195))
 - Added optional `scaleratio` argument to the `create_quiver` figure factory.
 When specified, the axes are restricted to this ratio and the quiver arrows
 are computed to have consistent lengths across angles.
 ([#1197](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1197))
 
### Fixed
 - Replace use of `pkg_resources.resource_string` with `pkgutil.get_data` to
 improve compatibility with `cx_Freeze`
 ([#1201](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1201))
 - An exception is no longer raised when an optional dependency raises an
 exception on import.  The exception is logged and plotly.py continues as if
 the dependency were not installed
 ([#1192](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1192))
 - Fixed invalid dendrogram axis labels when the points being clustered contain
 duplicate values
 ([#1186](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1186))
 - Added missing LICENSE.txt file to PyPI source distribution
 ([#765](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/765))

### JupyterLab Versions
For use with JupyterLab, the following versions of the following packages
must be installed:

 - Python Packages
   - plotly==3.3.0
   - ipywidgets>=7.2
   - notebook>=5.3
   - jupyterlab==0.34
   
 - JupyterLab Extensions

--------------------------------------------------
Release Name: v3.2.1
Tag Name: v3.2.1
Published at: 2018-09-14T14:19:03Z
Body: ## [3.2.1] - 2018-09-14
This is a patch release that fixes a few bugs and reintroduces a few
version 2 features that were not supported in version 3.

The bundled version of plotly.js remains at 1.40.1

### JupyterLab Versions
For use with JupyterLab, the following versions of the following packages
must be installed:

 - Python Packages
   - plotly==3.2.1
   - ipywidgets>=7.2
   - notebook>=5.3
   - jupyterlab==0.34
   
 - JupyterLab Extensions
   - plotlywidget@0.3.0
   - @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.37
   - @jupyterlab/plotly-extension@0.17

### Added
 - An optional `skip_invalid` argument has been added to the `Figure` and
  `FigureWidget` constructors. By default, `skip_invalid` is `False` and invalid
  figure properties will result in an exception (this is identical to the
  previous behavior).  When `skip_invalid` is set to `True`, invalid properties
  will instead be silently ignored. This argument replaces the `_raise`
  argument that was available in version 2, and makes it possible to import
  figure definitions from different plotly versions, where incompatible
  properties are ignored rather than causing an exception.
 - A `to_ordered_dict` method has been added to the `Figure` and `FigureWidget`
  classes. This method returns a representation of the figure as a nested
  structure of `OrdererdDict` and `list` instances where the keys in each
  `OrderedDict` are sorted alphabetically.  This method replaces the
  `get_ordered` method that was available in version 2, and makes it possible
  to traverse the nested structure of a figure in a deterministic order.

### Fixed
 - Pandas `Series` and `Index` objects storing `datetime` values were
   incorrectly cast to numeric arrays
   ([plotly/plotly.py#1160](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1160),
    [plotly/plotly.py#1163](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1163))
 - Numpy arrays with `uint64` datatype caused a `FigureWidget` error,
   and no figure was displayed
   ([plotly/plotly.py#1155](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1155),
    [plotly/plotly.py#1163](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1163))

    - Add scatterpolar and scatterpolargl attributes `r0`, `dr`, `theta0` and `dtheta`
      ([plotly/plotly.js#2895](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2895))
    - Add layout attributes `piecolorway` and `extendpiecolors` for more control over pie colors
      ([plotly/plotly.js#2870](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2870))
    - Add `splom` attribute `dimensions[i].axis.type` to easily override axis type in splom-generated axes
      ([plotly/plotly.js#2899](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2870))
    - Add support for on-graph text in `scatterpolargl` traces
      ([plotly/plotly.js#2895](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2895))

 - Support for offline static image export with the `to_image` and `write_image`
   functions in the new `plotly.io` package ([#1120](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1120)).
    - Note: Image export requires the plotly [orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca)
      command line utility and the [`psutil`](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) Python package.
 - New documentation sections covering [Static Image Export](https://plot.ly/python/static-image-export/)
   and [Orca Management](https://plot.ly/python/orca-management/) 
 - Support for displaying `FigureWidget` instances in static contexts
   (e.g. [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)) just like the built-in ipywidgets
 ([#1117](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1117))
 - Full integration of the Cividis colorscale ([#883](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/883))
 - conda packaging
   - From here forward, new versions of plotly.py will be published to the [plotly anaconda channel](https://anaconda.org/plotly/)
     on the same day they are published to PyPI.
     ([72ad0e4](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/commit/72ad0e4bf54bb8a06445d2ca55488ffc11c836a7))
   - The [`README`](README.md) now includes conda installation instructions alongside the pip instructions. 
   - In addition to the existing installation approaches, orca is now also available as a
     [conda package](https://anaconda.org/plotly/plotly-orca) from the plotly anaconda channel.

This is a major version with many exciting updates. See the [Introducing plotly.py 3.0.0](https://medium.com/@plotlygraphs/introducing-plotly-py-3-0-0-7bb1333f69c6) post for more information.

### JupyterLab plotlywidget version: 0.1.1

### Plotly.js version: 1.38.3

### Added
- Full Jupyter ipywidgets integration with the new `graph_objs.FigureWidget` class
- `FigureWidget` figures can be updated interactively using property assignment syntax
- The full trace and layout API is generated from the plotly schema to provide a great experience for interactive use in the notebook
- Support for setting array properties as numpy arrays. When numpy arrays are used, ipywidgets binary serialization protocol is used to avoid converting these to JSON strings.
- Context manager API for animation. Run `help(go.Figure().batch_animate)` for the full doc string.
- Perform automatic retries when communicating with plot.ly services. This introduces a new required dependency on the [retrying](https://pypi.org/project/retrying/) library.
- Improved data validation covering the full API with clear, informative error messages. This means that incorrect properties and/or values now always raise a `ValueError` with a description of the error, the invalid property, and the available properties on the level that it was placed in the graph object. Eg. `go.Scatter(foo=123)` raises a validation error. See https://plot.ly/python/reference/ for a reference to all valid properties and values in the Python API.
- Error message for `plotly.figure_factory.create_choropleth` is now helpful to Anaconda users who do not have the correct modules installed for the County Choropleth figure factory.

### Changed / Deprecated
Please see the [migration guid](migration-guide.md) for a full list of the changes and deprecations in version 3.0.0
--------------------------------------------------
Release Name: v2.0.0
Tag Name: v2.0.0
Published at: 2017-01-25T23:52:01Z
Body: Same as the pre-release, but this one corresponds to the `2.0.0` on PyPI and is the first official `2.x` release. Please note the deprecation section from the changelog (copied below for convenience).

## [2.0.0] - 2017-01-25

### Changed
- `plotly.exceptions.PlotlyRequestException` is _always_ raised for network
  failures. Previously either a `PlotlyError`, `PlotlyRequestException`, or a
  `requests.exceptions.ReqestException` could be raised. In particular, scripts
  which depend on `try-except` blocks containing network requests should be
  revisited.
- `plotly.py:sign_in` now validates to the plotly server specified in your
  config. If it cannot make a successful request, it raises a `PlotlyError`.
- `plotly.figure_factory` will raise an `ImportError` if `numpy` is not
  installed.
- `plotly.figure_factory.create_violin()` now has a `rugplot` parameter which
  determines whether or not a rugplot is draw beside each violin plot.

### Deprecated
- `plotly.tools.FigureFactory`. Use `plotly.figure_factory.*`.
- (optional imports) `plotly.tools._*_imported` It was private anyhow, but now
  it's gone. (e.g., `_numpy_imported`)
- (plotly v2 helper) `plotly.py._api_v2` It was private anyhow, but now it's
  gone.

--------------------------------------------------
